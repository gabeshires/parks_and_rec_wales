# south_wales_gov_jobs
Simple scraper to get jobs from South Wales local governments. Currently is a manual .py, have a few things in mind to improve it. I've scheduled so it sends an email weekly. To run this there needs to be an email and password txt file in same file as .py.
- [] Changing it to a class so it can be imported and ran in seperate script
- [] Adding in more South Wales local governments 
- [] Generalising the output all sites can be seen in one place (csv or other)
- [] Add in functionality to search through multiple pages
